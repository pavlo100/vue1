        Hi ðŸ‘‹! Thanks for visiting my site! I'm a {{ age }} year old hobbyist full stack web
        developer, based in PoznaÅ„, Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've started coding about 5 years ago, trying to learn C++. Now my main interests are OSS
        development in JavaScript and TypeScript, creating apps in Swift, and recently I've began
        learning Go. Check out <router-link to="/projects">projects</router-link> for some of my
        projects and contributions. Also go and see my
        <a href="https://blog.siekierski.ml">blog</a> - maybe one day I will start posting more
        often.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to take a look at stuff I use at everyday basis, I recommend looking at
        <router-link to="/uses">uses</router-link> ðŸ˜„.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I'm an author of Polish web development podcast -
        <a href="https://require.podcast.gq">Require Podcast</a>. If you can understand this
        difficult language, check it out ðŸŽ™.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides sitting in front of my computer, I really enjoy mountain biking, running, skiing,
        snowboarding and travelling (especially hiking in the mountains).
